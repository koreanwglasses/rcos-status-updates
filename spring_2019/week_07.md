## Last Week's Accomplishments

After spending hours trying to figure out how to get the tests work, I just decided to separate the files each test modifies so that the contents can be examined manually. I also coordinated with the people who write the curriculums to get a plan for this week.

## This Week's Plan

- Implement a way to better manage how files are merged, including
    - Excludes certain files/directories
    - Force overwrite or always leave some files
- Create a view for using the Warp Drive from within the plugin
- Figure out how to manage/figure out where to keep the files for the curriculum when setting up the project.
