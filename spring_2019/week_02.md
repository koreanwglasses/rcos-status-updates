## Last Week's Accomplishments

[https://github.com/codingandcommunity/copilot/commit/d5d0a9d4fe6a05380f20e4e758e21530b52a5e07][Commit] The model was restructured to separate the initialization and operations of the three major components: environment, testing, and Warp Drive (changing to different stages of the project).

Also, a new view was created for previewing Markdown files with a few extra features.

## This Week's Plan

Once we work out getting the environment setup and figuring out exactly how th econfiguration files will be set up, we can work independently on each part.

## Anything Blocking?

We are still fleshing out the configuration files and the file structure of the curriculum and project directories
