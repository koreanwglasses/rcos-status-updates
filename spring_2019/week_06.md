## Last Week's Accomplishments

The Warp Drive code has been fixed and now should splice files and copy over new files. Documentation for Warp Drive was also added to docs/. It seems to work okay, but the something about the tests seem to be failing. 

## This Week's Plan

This week I will fix the tests then work on creating an iterface in the plugin.
