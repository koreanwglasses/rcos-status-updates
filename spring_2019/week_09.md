## Last Week's Accomplishments

Warp Drive now works properly from within Atom itself. To achieve this, I had to implement other things such as a way to keep track where the project information is and figuring out which folder to use.

## This Week's Plan

Refactor the code (esp Warp Drive) so it feels less like a proof-of-concept, and is more reliable, flexible, and clear.
