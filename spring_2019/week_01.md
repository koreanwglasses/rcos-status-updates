## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the last few weeks I set up the framework for the Copilot package for Atom, which is one of the main user inferfaces for the Open Source Curriculum Project. Components include:
- Framework for the model/view/controllers
- Basic tests for project environment and fast forwarding
- Basic views for testing
- Integration with Atom panes
- TypeScript and JSX integration with etch

## This Week's Plan

This week the plan is to flesh out the specs for the testing portion of the curriculum, writing more specific tests for each of the major functionality components (environment, fast-forwarding, and testing), and to continue to improve the visual design and user experience of the plugin itself.

## Anything Blocking?

We are still working on finalizing/settling on a stable specification for the actual curriculum, so that we can start parsing and working with the curriculum.

## Notes

Everyone on the team for Copilot (Me (Fred), Brad, and Arron) are all up to date on the new framework and are just waiting on specs to start the real coding.
