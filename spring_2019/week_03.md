## Last Week's Accomplishments

The Warp Drive module of the Copilot plugin now reads from the configuration files (with unit tests to verify!). Also, an ad-hoc (possibly) solution was used to simply clone a repository from GitHub using nodegit, though there are concerns with compatibility considering that there were a few hiccups in my local installation. I have pushed that solution to a new branch.

## This Week's Plan

Communicate with other Copilot developers, have them develop their own unit tests, and coordinate how each module will setup their environment. Also comminucate with teammates on how to get basic project setup (downloading the project) working, since it is a requirement for all parts of the system. 

## Anything Blocking?

There's seems be a lack of small group meetings coming up, which will make it a bit more difficult to communicate, though this should not be much of a problem.
