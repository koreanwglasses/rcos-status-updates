## Last Week's Accomplishments

We are using node-git now since it is much lighter and is better suited to cross-platform development. Projects can now be setup by a github url from the plugin itself.

## This Week's Plan

Create a view to warp to different branches, add a way to exlude files from merging when fast forwarding.
