## Last Week's Accomplishments

The code for downloading a curriculum repository was merged into the master branch. In addition, an specification of the warp drive involving nested folders in the curriculum repository was prototyped. Here is how I understand it:

The first step will be contained in its own folder (maybe called "Step1"). Then subsequent steps (and possibly branching steps) are in the "Step1" folder. 

To merge / inject code from the next step, anchor comments are used to find which code in the next step should be copied to where in the current project.

## This Week's Plan

Make some simple test cases / proof of concept functionality of the warp drive based on the nested folder with anchor comments idea.
