## Last Week's Accomplishments

Added code for downloading the curriculum and setting up the actual project itself. Also cleaned up promises. Wrote unit tests for both the Environment Manager and the Warp Drive.

## This Week's Plan

The current code for the Warp Drive only works a single file at a time. Working on getting to work on any arbitrary set of files.
