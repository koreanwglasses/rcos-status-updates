## Last Week's Accomplishments

Over the last two weeks, there have been a lot of bug fixes and reliability improvements. Promises where cleaned up with async wherever neccessary, arrow functions were used instead of anonymous functions to avoid `this` indirection. The state of the plugin saves to a file to keep track of which stage the project is on. The parts of the model were changed up to reduce coupling, though there is still more work to do on this.

## This Week/Future Plan

Implement an ignore file, make the GUI prettier / make the UX more usable for beginners.
